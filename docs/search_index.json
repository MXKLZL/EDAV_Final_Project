["index.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Recommended Boroughs and Places for Full-Time Student to Live in Examination of Selected Crime Rate in New York City Yichi Zhang, Zelin Li, Huayun Xu, Mingfang Chang 2019-12-12 Chapter 1 Introduction Many full-time students at Columbia, including us, are living off-campus currently and may need to find new housing in the next semester or the next year. Among all the considerations while searching available apartments, Most students care most about the safety of areas surrounding the apartment. However, when googling the crime rate analysis, we find that they are not very instructive, as there are many crime types included that irrelevant to us. Hence the objective of our final project is that based on the crime types we care about, the time periods we go outside, and victim age group of crimes in each borough, finding the relatively safe areas by researching the crime rate of five boroughs, Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, in New York City. If possible, we would like to find the specific addresses in the selected borough which can be regarded as a reference of safety for all students who are finding housing. "],
["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 NYPD Complaint Data 2.2 United States Census Bureau Quick Facts", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 NYPD Complaint Data We obtain the data of crime events to be researched from NYC Open Data, and here is the link. This dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for all complete quarters so far this year (2019). Because we find the data at the end of October, the data is up to September 2019. Then we have download the dataset as a CSV file, and we also have download the explanation of each column name as a pdf file found from “About” on the right side of the website. There are 347074 observations with 35 variables in this dataset. These variables include information about the victim, suspect, location, date of crime, type of crime, description of crime and more. All crimes are divided into 62 different types. The problem is that this dataset is quite sparse, and some spatial and suspect information is missing. There is also some wrong information, for example, some crimes are reported in the year of 1018. We are interested in some of the variables and will pick them out in the cleaning section: BORO_NM: The name of the borough in which the incident occurred CMPLNT_FR_DT: Exact date of occurrence for the reported event (or starting date of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_DT exists) CMPLNT_FR_TM: Exact time of occurrence for the reported event (or starting time of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_TM exists) OFNS_DESC: Description of offense corresponding with key code PREM_TYP_DESC: Specific description of premises; grocery store, residence, street, etc. SUSP_AGE_GROUP: Suspect’s Age Group SUSP_SEX: Suspect’s Sex Description SUSP_RACE: Suspect’s Race Description VIC_AGE_GROUP: Victim’s Age Group VIC_RACE: Victim’s Race Description VIC_SEX: Victim’s Sex Description (D=Business/Organization, E=PSNY/People of the State of New York, F=Female, M=Male) Latitude: Midblock Latitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326) Longitude: Midblock Longitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326) 2.2 United States Census Bureau Quick Facts Another dataset we will use is the report of the population in each of 5 boroughs in New York City at the end of 2018 from the U.S. Census, which is downloaded from this link. Because currently we are in 2019 and there is no data of the population at the end of 2019, we will use this dataset to calculate the crime rate for each borough in the later research. "],
["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Convert Type and Fix Error in Data 3.2 Pick Out Relevant Crimes", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Convert Type and Fix Error in Data First of all, since we would like to analyze the occurrence time and date of each crime record, we change the types of corresponding columns to date and time. However, some crime records happen a long year ago(like the 1950s) but complete recently are included in the dataset. In order to keep our data up to date, we drop all records that happen before 2018-01-01. For error data such as record happened in 1018 or 1019, we fix it by inferring from other information in this record. 3.2 Pick Out Relevant Crimes Another goal of our exploration is to analyze the types of crime in each borough. However, some crime descriptions are too detailed. So we classify all of them into 11 types based on broader definitions of each type(like all offenses with different targets are classified as an offense). And all other types with low frequency and completely irrelevant to us such as gambling is dropped. Since not all columns in the original dataset are useful for our analysis, we select 13 columns that may be used for the following research, including location, time, suspect information, victim information, and the crime information. "],
["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We randomly sample 1000 data to analyze the missing value patterns of the dataset after cleaning the data. We also change the “UNKNOWN” entry to NA for convenience. From the plot above, we see that majority of missing data is from the columns: “SUSP_AGE_GEOUP”, “SUSP_SEX”, “SUSP_RACE”, “VIC_AGE_GROUP”, “VIC_RACE”, “Latitude” and “Longitude”. We also see that “Latitude” and “Longitude” are always missing together. We can further investigate the missing row patterns by missing_data.frame function. We find out that there are 30 different row missing patterns. Some of the patterns only have one or two occurrences and 20 of them have 10 occurrences or below. We can check how many times each of the row missing pattern appears in the data set by the following visualization. ## Warning in melt(as.data.frame(xs), ncol(xs)): The melt generic in ## data.table has been passed a data.frame and will attempt to redirect to the ## relevant reshape2 method; please note that reshape2 is deprecated, and this ## redirection is now deprecated as well. To continue using melt methods from ## reshape2 while both libraries are attached, e.g. melt.list, you can prepend ## the namespace like reshape2::melt(as.data.frame(xs)). In the next version, ## this warning will become an error. (Note that in the above plot, the columns represent the seven variables and the rows the missing patterns. The cells for the variables with missing values in the pattern are drawn in blue.) Therefore we observe the following missing row patterns: The pattern that occurs the most frequently is missing both Latitude and Longitude, which is about 92% of the data. The information on the suspect is missing such as age, sex, and race tends to be missing along with some other variables. Since the objective of our project is to analyze the safety issue, when doing the interactive part of the project, we will need to use the location information. So we have to drop all the data with Longitude and Latitude missing. This might affect the distribution of the crime, so we plot the following diagram to compare the distribution of crime types before and after the missing location data is removed. Base on the above two plots, we see that after the data with missing location is removed, the distribution of crime types is unchanged. So, the missing location is somewhat random and we are safe to remove it when doing the interactive part. However, before the interactive part, we will keep the records without longitude and latitude in order to preserve more information of our dataset. "],
["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Whcih Crime Types Are More Common in Each Borough? 5.2 Which Borough is Safer Based on Crime Time? 5.3 Which Borough is Safer for Student Age Groups?", " Chapter 5 Results In section 3, we have dropped some trivial crime types like “CRIMINAL MISCHIEF”, and now we only pay attention to the common crime types of events happening in NYC. There are 11 crime types in total, and we can see the frequency rank of them in the following graph. As we can see, THIEF is the most common crime in NYC, then we deduce that this phenomenon may result from the low cost of theft. Offense also appears very common, because there are many different types of crime that could be classified as OFFENCE. ARSON, MURDER, and KIDNAPPING are the least common crime types in the dataset. For the convenience of the later researches, we drop 5 types of crime from our dataset: ARSON, MURDER, KIDNAPPING, DRUG, and FRAUD. MURDER related data has a great amount of missing data for latitude and longitude, also ARSON, MURDER, and KIDNAPPING contain very few useful pieces of data, which is difficult to conduct instructive analysis. We drop FRAUD because this could be avoided effectively. For DRUG, although it is very common, it is the indirect reason for other crimes like offense or murder, the crime DRUG itself usually doesn’t cause great harm to society explicitly. 5.1 Whcih Crime Types Are More Common in Each Borough? ## Scale for &#39;fill&#39; is already present. Adding another scale for &#39;fill&#39;, ## which will replace the existing scale. After selecting the six crime types that most related to us, we take the population of each borough into account and calculate the crime rate of selected crimes in five boroughs. The Boroughs with the top three highest crime rates are Manhattan, Bronx, and Brooklyn, whereas Queens and Staten Island have lower crime rates, and this forms a spatial pattern in the graph. We are surprised about the finding because it breaks our “stereotype” that Brooklyn is the most dangerous borough in New York City. However, we cannot judge which borough is more dangerous for us and which borough is safer from this graph. Since a different person may have different ranks for the dangerousness of these crime types. The above graph shows the exact crime rate for each type in five boroughs. The most frequent crime types are OFFENSE and THEFT for all boroughs. As we discussed above, the cost of theft is the lowest and the definition of the offense is broadly defined, which could be the reason for the high frequency of these two crime types. Therefore, we focus on the other four crime types. Interestingly, Brooklyn has the highest crime rate for all four severe crime types(rape, robbery, weapon, burglary), but the total crime rate of Brooklyn is actually lower than that of Manhattan. It seems that the crimes happened in Brooklyn are more likely to be severe crimes. Bronx has the second highest total crime rate and also the second highest rate for all severe crime types. Therefore neither Bronx nor Brooklyn is a good choice for a student like us to live concerning safety. For Staten Island, the frequency of all crime types is significantly lower than those of the other four boroughs. From the safety concern, Staten Island may be a good choice for moving to. However, the commute time should also be taken into account for final decision making. 5.2 Which Borough is Safer Based on Crime Time? We want to figure out if there is a special time in 2019 that more crimes happened. So we build the following graph for recognizing time series patterns. As shown in the graph, more crimes happened in early January and summer in 2019. Early January, especially during the new year celebration time, since more people went out for celebrations, the raise in crime amount is reasonable. Besides, summer time is another period for more crimes. It is may because of the relation between weather and people’s moods. Since this research is aimed to find a suitable and safe region for university students to live, we want to see the time series pattern in each borough. Among 5 boroughs, There are small decline trends after August in all Boroughs except Manhattan, which means the crime rate for all Boroughs except Manhattan probabably will continue to decline after September. Since many lease periods begin around September, Queens may be a better choice to living than Manhattan from the plots above. As a student, we rent an apartment because we need to go to school or work. So it is very important to avoid the places that have a higher chance of crime when we are walking to school, or coming back home. Therefore, we have broken down the time periods that the crime happened into four ranges: 7 am - 11 am 11 am - 3 pm 3 pm - 7 pm 7 pm - 11 pm The period we care most about is the following: 7 am - 11 am (the time going to school or work) 3 pm - 7 pm (the time going back home ) 7 pm - 11 pm (the time going back home when we have night class) From the graph above, there is the same pattern for every borough. The descending order of number of crimes is 3pm -7pm, 11am - 3pm, 7pm - 11pm, and 7am - 11am. Separating the time period doesn’t help us figure out which borough has an apparent advantage to live. However, we can adjust our schedule base on the graph above. For example, if you live in Manhattan, going out before 11 am and back home after 7 pm can help you avoid more crimes. As full-time students, the frequency we go outside depends on days: we go out more frequently from Monday to Friday rather than weekends. Therefore we want to find a borough with a lower frequency of crime events in weekdays, and the plot is as follow: Based on the above plot, the weekdays’ pattern is similar for each borough, whereas for weekends the occurrence of crime events is relatively infrequent compared to weekdays. Since we will go outside more during weekdays, the graph above doesn’t help us find out the most suitable borough. However, the graph remind us that we should try to choose safer periods to go outside on Friday. 5.3 Which Borough is Safer for Student Age Groups? Since most of the full-time students are in the age group 18-24, and we want to find how these students including us are related to the victims of crime events, we extract the data of victims in 18-24 age group for each borough and draw the following barplot: df_age &lt;- subset(df_select, as.character(VIC_AGE_GROUP) %in% c(&quot;&lt;18&quot;, &quot;18-24&quot;, &quot;25-44&quot;, &quot;45-64&quot;,&quot;65+&quot;) ) df_age2&lt;-subset(df_age, as.character(VIC_AGE_GROUP)==&quot;18-24&quot;) #df_age2 &lt;- df_age2$VIC_AGE_GROUP df_age2 &lt;-df_age2%&gt;% group_by(df_age2$BORO_NM) %&gt;% summarise(count=n())%&gt;% ungroup() names(df_age2)[1] &lt;- &quot;Borough&quot; df_age2$count &lt;- df_age2$count/ChorDF$Population*100000 names(df_age2)[2] &lt;- &quot;Rate&quot; ggplot(df_age2, aes(x=reorder(Borough, -Rate), y=Rate))+ geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;,fill=&quot;lightblue&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Boroughs&quot;)+ ggtitle(paste(&quot;The Number of Victims per 100000 People&quot;, &quot;in 18-24 Age Group by Boroughs in New York City&quot;, sep=&quot;\\n&quot;))+ theme_grey(16) For the plot above, we convert the count of crime events to crime rate per 100000 people, and we can see clearly that Manhattan has the largest crime rate for the age group 18-24, while Staten Island and Queens have the smallest crime rate. Combining with the result from crime types part(Manhattan and Queens are two best choices), Queens should be a better choice for full-time student than Manhattan. "],
["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Select Your Schedule 6.2 Select Crimes You Concern Most", " Chapter 6 Interactive component As we discussed in the previous chapters, Queens and Manhattan should be the best two boroughs for us. However, the best choice is based on our criteria, and we don’t compare the crime rates of the specific places inside each borough. The following two interactive graphs provide customization of both the time periods and crime types for people with different preferences and help people identify the safe places in each borough. 6.1 Select Your Schedule Different people have different schedules; for instance, some students only have class in the afternoon, then the time period they go to school should be 11 am - 3 pm. On the top right corner, there are several checkboxes. The audience can choose some time periods based on their own schedules. And the crime distribution in New York City for the selected time period will appear on the map. The number in each circle shows the total number of crimes in the area surrounding the address. Clicking the circle shown on the graph can zoom into a smaller scope. Eventually, when the zoom becomes smaller enough, the circle will become pin push in the graph and if you click the pin push, it will show the exact crime time, victim age group, victim sex, and victim race. 6.2 Select Crimes You Concern Most Different people may also have a different rank in the dangerousness of the crime types. For females, they may be more afraid of rape and prefer to choose address with extremely low rape rate. For Male, they may want to live in place with less burglary and robbery. In the interactive graph, there are several checkboxes on the top right corner, and users can choose from crime types to find the exact address in each borough based on their own crime rank. Same as the graph above, You can click the circle continuously to zoom into a smaller scope and click the pin push, it will show you the exact crime time, victim age group, victim sex, and victim race.

["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Boroughs We Recommend 7.2 Specific Places for Selected Borough 7.3 Limitation", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Boroughs We Recommend Based on concerns about crime type, crime time, and victim age group, the three safer boroughs are Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island. Although Manhattan has a higher total crime rate than Brooklyn and Bronx, the major crime types in Manhattan actually are offense and theft, which do not directly endanger our lives. For Brooklyn and Bronx, these two boroughs have top two highest crime rates in the most severe crime types(rape, robbery, weapon, burglary). For Staten Island, if commute time is considered, it may not a good choice for students who attend university in Manhattan. Therefore, we recommend full-time students to live in Manhattan and Queens. 7.2 Specific Places for Selected Borough For more detailed address, we find out two specific places from our interactive graph based on our schedule and rank. The first place we recommend is Long Island City in Queens. In the interactive graph, there are only 4 crimes(three theft and one offense) happened in here and even no recorded crime at 7 am - 11 am. These four crimes are not considered severe crimes in our criteria. The second place is Roosevelt Island, which has only two recorded thefts and has no recorded crime at 7 pm - 11 pm. It should be a good choice for students with more courses in the afternoon and evening. For students who would like to live in Manhattan, Manhattan downtown has lower crime at 7 am - 11 am and 7 pm - 11 pm, and both midtown and downtown have less severe crimes than uptown. 7.3 Limitation However, safety is not the only criteria for choosing a place to live in. There are some other factors, such as commute time and price, should also be taken into account. In our research, we only use selected crime rates to select the best place for students. Luckily, the commute time from two addresses we selected to Manhattan is in an acceptable range in our knowledge. Another limitation is that, as we know, a lot of students in Manhattan also consider New Jersey as a good place to live in because of its acceptable commute time and lower price, while the crime record of the place near New York City has not included into our dataset. For future research, we may include the crime record of the area close to NYC in New Jersy and make analysis about the rent price, commute time and other factors. We believe that if we do further research, more suitable places for full-time student to live in can be found. "]
