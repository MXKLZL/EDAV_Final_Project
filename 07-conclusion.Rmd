# Conclusion



## Borough We Recommend
Base on concerning about crime type, crime time, and victim age gourp, the three safer boroughs should be Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island. Although the Manhattan has higher total crime rate than Brooklyn and Bronx, the major crime types in Manhattan actually are offense and theft which doesn't directly endanger our live. For Brooklyn and Bronx, these two boroughs have highest and second highest crime rate in the most severe cirme types(Rape,Robbery,weapon,burglary). For Staten Island, we can see the staten island is little far away from all other boroughs. So it's may not a good choice for student who attend university at Manhattan. Therefore, we recommend the full-time students to live in Manhattan and Queens.

In interactive graph, there are only 4 crimes(three theft and one offense) happen near that that place and even no recorded crime in 7am - 11am. These four crime are not considered as severe crime in our criteria. The second place is Roosevelt Island which have only two recoded theft and have no recorded crime in 7pm - 11pm.
