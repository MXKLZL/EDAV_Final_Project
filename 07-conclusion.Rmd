# Conclusion



## Borough We Recommend
Base on concerning about crime type, crime time, and victim age gourp, the three safer boroughs should be Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island. Although the Manhattan has higher total crime rate than Brooklyn and Bronx, the major crime types in Manhattan actually are offense and theft which doesn't directly endanger our live. For Brooklyn and Bronx, these two boroughs have highest and second highest crime rate in the most severe cirme types(Rape,Robbery,weapon,burglary). For Staten Island, if we consider the commute time, it may not a good choice for student who attend university at Manhattan. Therefore, we recommend the full-time students to live in Manhattan and Queens.

## Specific Address for Selected Borough
For the more detailed address, we find out two specific address from our interactive graph base on our schedule and rank. The first place we recommend is long island city in Queens. In interactive graph, there are only 4 crimes(three theft and one offense) happen near that that place and even no recorded crime in 7am - 11am. These four crime are not considered as severe crime in our criteria. The second place is Roosevelt Island which have only two recoded theft and have no recorded crime in 7pm - 11pm. It should be a good chooice for student who have more courses in the afternoon and evening. For student who would like to live in Manhttan, Manhattan downtown have lower crime in 7am - 11am and 7pm-11pm and both midtown and downtown have less severe crime than uptown.

## Limitation
However, safety is not the only criteria for choosing a place to live in. There are some other factors such as communte time and price should also be take into account. In our research, we only use selected crime rate to select the best place for students. Luckily, the commute time from two address we selected to Manhattan is in acceptable range in our knowledge. Another limitation is that, as we know, lot of student in Manhattan also consider New Jersey as a good place to living in because of its acceptable communte time and lower price, while the crime record of the place near New York City have not included into our dataset. For the future research, we should include the crime record of area in New jersy and give other anaysis about the rent price and communte time. We beleive if we do that, we can find more suitable place for full time student to live in.
