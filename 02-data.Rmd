# Data sources

We got the data of crime events to be researched from NYC Open Data, and here is the [link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/data).

This dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for all complete quarters so far this year (2019). Because we found the data in the end of October, the data is up to September, 2019. Then we downloaded the dataset as a csv file, and we also downloaded the explanation of each column name as a pdf file found from "About" in the right side of the website.

There is 347074 observation with 35 variables in this dataset. The variables included information about the victim, subspect, location and date of the crime, type of crime, description of the crime and more. The crime is broken down into 62 different types. The problem with this dataset is that the dataset is really sparse and lots of spatial and suspect information is missing. There is some information entered wrong, for example, some crime are reported in the year of 1018.

Another dataset is the population in each of 5 boroughs in New York City in 2018, and we downloaded it from the following [link](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcountymanhattanboroughnewyork,bronxcountybronxboroughnewyork,queenscountyqueensboroughnewyork,kingscountybrooklynboroughnewyork,richmondcountystatenislandboroughnewyork,newyorkcitynewyork/HSG010218).

Because currently we are in 2019 and there is no data of population in the end of 2019, we will use this dataset to calculate the crime rate for each borough in the later research.

Dataset reading is shown in later chapter.
